# Comparison of EVMPatch and SafeMath on 5 well-known CVEs

We use these 5 contracts for a comparison of EVMPatch bytecode-rewriter
patching vs. manual source-code patching with the SafeMath library.

* `./*/*.sol` is the original source code as obtained from etherscan
* `./_safemath_manual` contains the source-level patches
* `./osiris.sh` is the script we used to run osiris on the contracts.

For the Contracts we always have three versions of the runtime bytecode (without constructor code):
* `./*/*.bin` is the compiled original EVM bytecode
* `./*/*.evmpatched.bin` is the original EVM bytecode patched with EVMPatch
* `./*/*.safemath.bin` is the modified source code compiled with the same
  compiler
